This script is for backup up all mysql databases in separate table files.

The script is used as a daily cron (/etc/cron.daily/mysql) and can be
configured through the defaults config file (/etc/default/mysql_backup.conf)

As default, each database is dumped in a single directory, all tables as own data
and structure files. The backup is split up in a latest and an archive folder in
which each backup time has it's own subfolder and the lates folder contains
hardlinks to the latest backup.

Created for backup various debian installations, so there is a deb package.
to build the package, use: dpkg-deb --build mysql-backup mysql-backup-0.1.2-0.deb

For testing if this script runs as predicted, run it in your configured
cron environment:
$ env - `cat /etc/crontab | grep -v "#" | grep -v "^$" | grep -v /etc/cron` /etc/cron.daily/mysql

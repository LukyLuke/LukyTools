# Fixes and Tools for GnuCash 

Here I publish Fixes, tools and others which ma be usefull for GnuCASH

## gnome-keyring-fix

Thats a small fix to disable the *gnome-keyring-save-password* feature. I made this because after an update of some libraries, gnucash wasn't working anymore after the password-dialog - the gnome-keyring-deamon was still running in the background, but even GnuCash nor the Keyring-Daemon were showing debug messages.
